# Foreword

The AI-Extensions project aims at supporting the Earth Science and Services Communities by expanding the existing Earth Observation (EO) platform offerings services with operationally mature AI/ML software capabilities. This is achieved through the AI-Extension Application Hub, a dedicated Cloud platform that provides the integration and operational implementation of EO and AI capabilities.  

This User Manual provides a guideline, as well as step-by-step instructions, for developers and consumers to effectively leverage the AI-Extension Application Hub.
