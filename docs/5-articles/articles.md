# Articles

A number of descriptive and informative articles, one for each User Scenario, have been written and published on Terradue’s Discuss platform. Each article describes one Jupyter Notebook, or an Application Package CWL, with information regarding the User Scenario(s) in a user-friendly way, its implementation via the Notebook(s) and the generated outputs, as well as links to relevant resources. 

Below are the links to all project articles:
