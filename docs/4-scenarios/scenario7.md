# User Scenario 7 â€‹- Alice describes her trained machine learning model

This Scenario leverabes the capabilities of STAC to provide a comprehensive and standardised description of a trained ML model. The user will create a STAC Item file that encapsulates the relevant metadata, such as: model name and version, description of the model architecture and training process, specifications of input and output data formats, performance metrics and evaluation results, details regarding model deployment and usage. This approach not only facilitates collaboration but also promotes interoperability within the geospatial and ML communities.
