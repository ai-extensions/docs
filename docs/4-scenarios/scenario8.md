# User Scenario 8 -â€‹ Alice reuses an existing pre-trained model

In this Scenario, Alice leverages the power of transfer learning (a widely adopted technique in deep learning that involves employing a pre-trained model on a large dataset (such as ImageNet) as a starting point to train a new ML model on a smaller dataset) by utilising a pre-trained ML model as a foundation for her ML endeavours. This allows the new ML model to achieve higher accuracy even when trained with limited data.
