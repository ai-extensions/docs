# User Scenario 10 - Eric discovers a model and consumes it

In this Scenario, a geospatial data analyst such as Eric discovers an ML model, created by other practitioners such as Alice, by using the STAC catalogâ€™s search functionalities. This enables Eric to use relevant keywords, such as the model name, geographic location, or application domain, to narrow down the search. The data catalog's search interface allows Eric to explore the available ML models that match the search criteria and are described using STAC. Once the ML model is found, it can be run on other geospatial data, integrating it into a larger workflow, or applying it within a specific application context. The ML model will then be deployed as a processing service on an exploitation platform using the OGC API processes. By following these steps, Eric can seamlessly integrate Alice's model into his existing infrastructure and leverage its capabilities within his geospatial analysis workflows.
