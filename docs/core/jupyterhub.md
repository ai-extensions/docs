# JupyterHub
JupyterHub is a dedicated multi-user server that brings the power of JupyterLab to collaborative environments. It allows organizations to effortlessly deploy and manage Jupyter Notebook servers for multiple users, enabling seamless collaboration and resource sharing in data science and research settings. Link to the official documentation: https://jupyter.org/.

After login on your dedicated App Hub instance (e.g. [https://app-hub-ai-extensions-dev.terradue.com/](https://app-hub-ai-extensions-dev.terradue.com/)), you will be given the choice between different server options. These options are user-specific and depend on your registration profile settings.
